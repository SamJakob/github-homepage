See the README on the `master` branch for details.

This is the manifest-v2 version submitted to the Firefox Extension Marketplace.
The v2 and v3 versions are identical other than the version number in `manifest.json`, they just work slightly differently in the browser.

In this case, having the v2 version instead of v3 simply saves you having to manually authorize access for github.com to the extension.
